# pharmacy-store
This project is a pharmacy management system using python, csv as database and tkinter as UI.

Lets me take you through the flow of program.
As you will run the program small window will get open,
then there are two options click on medicine list button or add item button
on clicking medicine list button you will find the list of all medicines present in the csv file
from here you can click the edit list button or back button.
The Edit list button will make the sheet editable and after doing the changes make sure none of the cell has blue border and then click save else it would not reflect the changes.
And final if you click on add item simple a single row will get created at the last of the list.
